# recipe-maker-electron
Current Porting Progress:  
Recipe.java - Not Started  
RecipeMaker.java - Not Started  
RecipeMakerUI.java - Not Started  

This is a project for a desktop app in Electron that is designed to be a recipe maker and manager.  
The code will be ported from a version of the app I did in Java (N.b. Java:JavaScript :: ham:hamster).  
In RecipeMaker folder/directory, there is the original Java code that this project will be based off of.  
None of the actual code will be used; it is only there for reference. No pull requests for that code will be approved.  
If you are working on the frontend, start by reading RecipeMakerUI.java. Once that is complete, you can help with the UI code contained in RecipeMaker.java.  
If you are working on the backend, start by reading either RecipeMaker.java or Recipe.java.  
I will keep you posted here in this README on where we are in porting the project.  
This information will be kept at the top of this README, so check for updates before continuing work.  
If you know anyone who would like to help with development, please direct them to the project.  
Thank you for your help and happy programming!
