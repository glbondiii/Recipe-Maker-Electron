# recipe-maker-electron
Current Porting Progress:  
Recipe.java - Finished 
RecipeMaker.java (i.e. the functionality) - In Progress  
RecipeMakerUI.java (i.e. the GUI) - Not Started  

This is a project for a desktop app in Electron (framework for web design languages [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(or TypeScript)] that is used to make desktop apps for all major operating systems) that is designed to be a recipe maker and manager.  
The code will be ported from a version of the app I did in Java.  
In RecipeMaker-OriginalJava folder/directory, there is the original Java code that this project will be based off of.  
The code for the Electron app is found in the recipe-maker-electron folder/directory.
None of the Java code will actually be used; it is only there for reference. No pull requests for that code will be approved.  
If you plan to work on the GUI, start by reading RecipeMakerUI.java, and then read over and start working in the .html and .css files in the src folder in recipe-maker-electron.  
Also, it would also be helpful if you could skim over the renderer.ts and RecipeMaker.ts file in the same src folder to get an idea for what id tags to use.
Alternatively, if you have Java installed, you can run the code directly in the terminal by running the command "java RecipeMakerUI" and navigating the Java app.
If you plan to work on the functionality, start by reading either RecipeMaker.java or Recipe.java, and then read over and start working in the .ts files in the src folder in recipe-maker-electron.  
I will keep you posted here in this README on our progress in porting the project.  
This information will be kept at the top of this README, so check for updates before continuing work.  
If you know anyone who would like to help with development, please direct them to the project.  
Thank you for your help!
